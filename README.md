## Summary

This project automates the process of tracking daily expenses noted in a text file. The script performs the following tasks:

- __Download the Text File:__ Retrieves the text file containing the expense records from a note-taking app.
- __Parse and Clean Data:__ Reads and corrects any typing errors in the expense entries.
- __Fill Website Form:__ Inputs the cleaned expense data into a specified website for tracking purposes.
- __Generate PDF Report:__ Creates a PDF document that includes a copy of the expense history.
  - Adds a summary line with the category that has the highest expenses.
  - Adds another summary line indicating the shop/company where the highest amount was spent.

The project ensures an efficient and error-free way to manage and report daily expenses, saving time and reducing manual effort.
